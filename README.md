## Data generation scripts

### TODO:

* location of locations_partitions.csv is hardcoded
* parallelize so it doesn't take so long
* fix bug that generates data past user defined end date
* come up with a realistic template so numbers aren't out of whack
* allow user defined customer data, more categories, and generally more versatile
* think about analysis that can be done --> add more columns
* minor: add adds weeks to the start date so we don't get data for the final half week
* script to calculate expected outputs based on profiles
